This paper examines the influence of peers on adolescent alcohol use which is a "major public health challenge." The paper analyzes a survey of alcohol usage of seventh through eleventh grade students enrolled between 1995 and 1996. From the start and end survey results, they develop an actor-based model to model the "co-evolution of alcohol use and friendship connections". A Method of Moments (Mom) algorithm compares the network observed from the data "to hypothetical networks generated through repeated Monte Carlo simulations." The model consists of friendship network evolution and alcohol use behavior. The model attempts to explain the reasons behind adolescent drinking by finding the optimal starting values for the start data to end up as the end data of the survey. Essentially, by knowing what the starting behavior of the agents is and what the end behavior behavior is, the model aims to explain how agents change over time.
