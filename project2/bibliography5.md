This paper examines the use of "cooperative, distributed multi-agent systems to improve dynamic routing and traffic management." Agents consist of intelligent route guidance systems (ISP) and drivers. They conclude that negotiation of "efficient route allocation across time and space," lead to more optimal performance and driver satisfaction. ISPs gather information about the current traffic and use that information to direct drivers. Each driver has a different goal, route preference, and weights (these weights are factors in an algorithm). They model the result of the cooperation between ISPs and drivers. The paper concludes that drivers having the ability to negotiate their path leads to a more efficent system.
