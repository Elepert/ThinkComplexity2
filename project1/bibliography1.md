This paper discusses how identifying the "critical components of a given communication-transportation network" could diminish the impact of terrorist attacks as well as disrupting the terrorist organization. The paper models the communication network as a graph. Each location is a node and the links are Internet channels between each location. They measure the importance of a node by measuring the drop in the network perfomance when they remove that node. Through analysis and simulation they predict the importance of each location to a terrorist network. They use the execution and aftermath of 9/11 to validate their model.
