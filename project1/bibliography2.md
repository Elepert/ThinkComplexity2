This paper discusses how complexity science can be applied to "performance assessment and system design" of transport networks. It investigates new "passenger prioritisation scenarios" and made a "passenger connectivity simulation of the European air transport network" by building a network graph. The paper modeled airport and transport patterns from real data from 2010. One thing the simulation accomplishes is it demonstrates that small airports contribute greatly to propagating flight delays throughout the transport network.
