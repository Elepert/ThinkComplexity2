This paper discusses how to separate a large network into smaller communities and the impact of doing so on being able to analyze networks. They found that "the web of communities has non-trivial correlations and specific scaling properties". They applied their method to binary networks (author community, proteins). Based on figuring out which community a protein belonged to, they were able to make an educated guess as to the function of a protein whose function is not yet known. Previous methods restrict each node to being a part of a single community, while their method keeps the communities intact, revealing interesting behavior between communities, especially when they overlap.
